I know nothing about licenses and have homework to do, but the licence of this
is as follows: To use, you must do everything in your power to make sure that
this project follows all rules of its parent libraries, especially GLFW and 
OpenGL. This means sending me an email at "steventrouble at gmail dot com" with
instructions on how to make this follow their licenses and stuff. Else, next 
time I have more time, I'll do it on my own.
